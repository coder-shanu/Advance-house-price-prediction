üè† Advanced House Price Prediction
Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Developed a machine learning model to predict house prices using advanced regression techniques and data preprocessing.

Collected and cleaned real-world housing datasets to handle missing values, outliers, and skewed distributions.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering to identify important predictors like square footage, location, year built, etc.

Applied multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest) and evaluated them using RMSE and R¬≤.

Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

Visualized feature importance and model results to make predictions explainable.

Achieved high prediction accuracy and demonstrated strong understanding of regression and model evaluation.
